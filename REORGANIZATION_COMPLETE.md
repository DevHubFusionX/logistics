## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before
```jsx
// 11 separate import lines
import { PageHeader } from '../components/dashboard/index'
import { useToast } from '../components/ui/advanced'
import { useLogisticsShortcuts } from '../hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts'
import { mockDrivers } from '../components/drivers/driversData'
import { sanitizeInput } from '../utils/sanitize'
import DriverStats from '../components/drivers/DriverStats'
import DriverFilters from '../components/drivers/DriverFilters'
import DriverTable from '../components/drivers/DriverTable'
import DriverModal from '../components/drivers/DriverModal'
import AddDriverModal from '../components/drivers/AddDriverModal'
```

### After
```jsx
// 6 grouped import lines (45% reduction!)
import { PageHeader } from '../components/dashboard'
import { useToast } from '../components/ui/advanced'
import { useLogisticsShortcuts } from '../hooks'
import { sanitizeInput } from '../utils'
import { 
  DriverStats, 
  DriverFilters, 
  DriverTable, 
  DriverModal, 
  AddDriverModal,
  mockDrivers 
} from '../components/drivers'
```

## 💡 How to Use

### When Creating New Components

```jsx
// 1. Create component file
// src/components/feature/NewComponent.jsx
export default function NewComponent() {
  return <div>New Component</div>
}

// 2. Add to barrel export
// src/components/feature/index.js
export { default as NewComponent } from './NewComponent'

// 3. Use anywhere
import { NewComponent } from '../components/feature'
```

### When Updating Existing Pages

```jsx
// 1. Open the page file
// 2. Find all imports from components/
// 3. Group by folder
// 4. Replace with barrel imports
// 5. Test the page
```
