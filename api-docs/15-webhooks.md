# Webhooks

## Overview
Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in the Dara Express system. Instead of polling the API, you can subscribe to events and receive HTTP POST requests to your specified endpoint.

## Webhook Payload Format

All webhook payloads follow this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "event_001",
  "event": "booking.created",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-31T15:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "bookingId": "BKG-2024-001",
    "customerId": "usr_026",
    "status": "pending",
    "amount": 125000,
    "route": "Lagos â†’ Abuja"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "environment": "production",
    "apiVersion": "v1"
  }
}
```

---

## Security

### Signature Verification

Each webhook request includes a signature in the `X-Dara-Signature` header:

```
X-Dara-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

**Verify signature:**
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest('hex');
  
  return `sha256=${hash}` === signature;
}
```

### Headers
```http
POST /your-webhook-endpoint
Content-Type: application/json
X-Dara-Signature: sha256=abc123...
X-Dara-Event: booking.created
X-Dara-Delivery: event_001
User-Agent: DaraExpress-Webhook/1.0
```

---

## Retry Policy

- Failed webhooks are retried automatically
- Retry schedule: 1min, 5min, 15min, 1hour, 6hours
- Maximum 5 retry attempts
- Webhook disabled after 10 consecutive failures
- HTTP status codes 2xx considered success
- Timeout: 30 seconds

---

## Best Practices

1. **Respond Quickly**
   - Return 200 OK immediately
   - Process webhook asynchronously

2. **Verify Signatures**
   - Always verify webhook signatures
   - Use constant-time comparison

3. **Handle Duplicates**
   - Use event ID for idempotency
   - Store processed event IDs

4. **Monitor Failures**
   - Set up alerts for failed webhooks
   - Review logs regularly

5. **Use HTTPS**
   - Only HTTPS endpoints accepted
   - Valid SSL certificate required

---

## Example Implementation

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhooks/daraexpress', (req, res) => {
  // 1. Verify signature
  const signature = req.headers['x-dara-signature'];
  const secret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  
  if (!verifySignature(req.body, signature, secret)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  // 2. Respond immediately
  res.status(200).send('OK');
  
  // 3. Process asynchronously
  processWebhook(req.body);
});

async function processWebhook(payload) {
  const { event, data } = payload;
  
  switch (event) {
    case 'booking.created':
      await handleBookingCreated(data);
      break;
    case 'trip.completed':
      await handleTripCompleted(data);
      break;
    // ... handle other events
  }
}
```
