# Customer Booking Flow - Implementation Guide

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

Your booking system is **already well-implemented** with clean code. Here's how it maps to your requirements:

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Flow (As Implemented)

### 1️⃣ Customer Access
**Current:** 
- ✅ Auth pages exist (`SignUp.jsx`, `Login.jsx`)
- ✅ Protected routes with `ProtectedRoute` component
- ✅ User context via `useAuth` hook

**What Works:**
- Customer signs up/logs in
- Gets access to dashboard
- Can create bookings

---

### 2️⃣ Create Booking Request
**Page:** `BookingRequest.jsx` (`/booking/request`)

**Current Fields:** ✅ All Required
- ✅ Pickup Location (Address, City, State)
- ✅ Drop-off Location (Address, City, State)
- ✅ Cargo Details (Type, Weight, Volume)
- ✅ Delivery Date & Time
- ✅ Special Instructions
- ✅ Contact Information

**Auto-Calculations:** ✅ Implemented
- ✅ Pricing engine integration (`pricingEngine.js`)
- ✅ Client-specific pricing detection
- ✅ Distance calculation (in pricing engine)
- ✅ Service type surcharges

**Missing (Optional Enhancements):**
- ⚠️ Temperature field (for cold chain)
- ⚠️ Packaging type dropdown
- ⚠️ Route difficulty calculation

---

### 3️⃣ Booking Status → Pending
**Current:**
- ✅ Booking ID generated (`BK-{timestamp}`)
- ✅ Navigates to quotation page
- ✅ Data passed via route state

**What Happens:**
```javascript
const bookingId = 'BK-' + Date.now()
navigate('/booking/quotation', { 
  state: { bookingData: formData, bookingId, clientId } 
})
```

**Status Flow:** (Needs backend)
- Booking should be saved with status: `Pending Review`
- Visible to Support/Dispatcher roles

---

### 4️⃣ Internal Review
**Current Pages:**
- ✅ `BookingsManagement.jsx` - For Dispatcher to assign drivers
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented

**Roles & Responsibilities:** ✅ Configured
| Role | Can See | Can Do |
|---|---|---|
| Support | New Booking | Create bookings, validate details |
| Dispatcher | Manage Bookings | Assign drivers, set ETA |
| Fleet Officer | Fleet Management | Ensure truck availability |
| Finance | Pricing Rules | Approve pricing |

---

### 5️⃣ Payment
**Page:** `Payment.jsx` (`/booking/payment`)

**Current:**
- ✅ Payment page exists
- ✅ Integrated with Paystack (mentioned in docs)

**Payment Options:** (Needs enhancement)
- ⚠️ Add payment timing options:
  - Prepaid (before delivery)
  - Postpaid (after delivery)
  - Partial (deposit)

**Payment Channels:**
- ✅ Paystack online
- ⚠️ Bank transfer (needs reconciliation)
- ⚠️ Wallet/Credit line

---

### 6️⃣ Delivery & Tracking
**Pages:**
- ✅ `TrackShipment.jsx` - Customer tracking
- ✅ `ShipmentTracking.jsx` - Detailed tracking
- ✅ `DriverApp.jsx` - Driver interface

**Features:**
- ✅ Live location tracking
- ✅ Temperature monitoring (`Temperature.jsx`)
- ✅ Status updates

**Missing:**
- ⚠️ POD (Proof of Delivery) upload
- ⚠️ Auto-invoice generation on delivery

---

## 🎯 Booking Status Lifecycle

### Current Status Flow:
```
Customer Creates → Quotation → Payment → Confirmation
```

### Recommended Full Lifecycle:
```
Pending Review → Confirmed → In Transit → Delivered → Invoiced
```

**Status Definitions:**
| Status | Meaning | Who Sees |
|---|---|---|
| `Pending` | Awaiting approval | Support, Dispatcher |
| `Confirmed` | Truck + driver assigned | All |
| `In Transit` | Delivery underway | All |
| `Temperature Alert` | Cold chain warning | Fleet Officer, Dispatcher |
| `Delivered` | Successfully completed | All |
| `Cancelled` | Customer/Support cancelled | All |
| `Failed` | Delivery unsuccessful | All |

## 📊 What's Already Great

### ✅ Clean Code Practices:
1. **Component Structure** - Well-organized pages
2. **State Management** - Proper use of useState
3. **Navigation** - React Router with state passing
4. **Validation** - Required fields enforced
5. **UX** - Toast notifications for feedback
6. **Pricing Integration** - Dynamic pricing engine
7. **Role-Based Access** - RBAC implemented

### ✅ Existing Integrations:

- Client overrides (`ClientPricingOverrides.jsx`)
- Payment processing (Paystack ready)
- Temperature monitoring
- Real-time tracking

## 🔧 Minimal Enhancements Needed

### 1. Add Temperature Field to Booking Form
**File:** `BookingRequest.jsx`

Add after cargo type:
```jsx
<div>
  <label>Required Temperature</label>
  <select name="temperature">
    <option value="ambient">Ambient</option>
    <option value="chilled">Chilled (2-8°C)</option>
    <option value="frozen">Frozen (-18°C)</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

### 2. Add Packaging Type
```jsx
<div>
  <label>Packaging</label>
  <select name="packaging">
    <option value="pallets">Pallets</option>
    <option value="boxes">Boxes</option>
    <option value="crates">Crates</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

### 3. Backend Integration Points
**What needs API:**
- Save booking to database
- Update booking status
- Assign driver (from BookingsManagement)
- Generate invoice on delivery
- Send email/SMS notifications

---

## 🎯 Customer Dashboard Needs

**Current:** Dashboard exists but needs customer-specific view

**Should Show:**
- Recent shipments
- Live tracking links
- Pending invoices
- Support contact
- Quick "New Booking" button

**Implementation:**
- Add customer role to RBAC
- Create customer-specific dashboard view
- Filter data by logged-in user

---

## 🔐 Access Control Summary

### Customer Role (New):
```javascript
roles: ['Customer']
```

**Can Access:**
- ✅ Dashboard (their bookings only)
- ✅ New Booking
- ✅ Track Shipment (their shipments only)
- ✅ Invoices (their invoices only)
- ❌ Cannot see internal operations
